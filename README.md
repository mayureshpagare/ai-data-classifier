# AI Enhanced Data Classifier

This project implements a keyword-driven data classifier to tag and segment unstructured data logs, such as customer complaints. It leverages PySpark for distributed processing and is containerized using Docker for consistent deployment.

## Features

* **Keyword-Driven Classification:** Tags data logs based on predefined keywords.
* **PySpark for Scalability:** Utilizes PySpark for efficient processing of large datasets.
* **Dockerized Deployment:** Ensures a consistent and isolated environment.
* **CI/CD Ready:** Designed for integration into automated deployment pipelines.

## Project Structure

* `src/`: Contains the core Python and PySpark classification logic.
* `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the application.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.
* `config.py`: Stores configuration parameters like keywords.

## Setup and Usage
